Selenium is Package which provide many modules. One of which is webdriver.
Web Driver has many class and methods which it provides for different types of browser

webdriver is also called API because it communicates with browser drivers like an API. In Selenium3 this communication use JSON
protocols. However, it is replaced(selenium4) with W3C(Http over Http server) as the communication between browsers drivers and
browser done in W3C. This is to keep the uniformity and solve the instability issues.

Installation:
1. Get installation command for stable version from https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ and install in pyCharm through
terminal
2. Download browser drivers compatible with install browsers

Types of locator: This cab be directly found in the html of the web page
1. Id
2. Name
3. Linktext and partial Linktext : any text at the end of element is linktext
Example : <input name='alsnalsc' id='12nk'>Name </input> here Name is linktext
         : <a herf='links'> Register </a> here Register is linktext.
And some text from linktext is called partial link text. like Reg will be called partial linktext from Register

Class Name and Tagname are the locators which are used to find more than one element at once using find_elements() and
not using find_element(). Same is the case with Tagname
4. Class Name
5. TagName

Q. find all the links in the web page
Answer : link_elements = driver.find_elements(by.TAG_NAME, 'a')
         print(len(link_elements))

Customized Locator: These cannot be found directly html code of the web page. These are generated using some tool
1. CSS Selector : This is combination of different locator:
    a. Tag and Id => <tag_name>#<id>
    b. Tag and class => <tag_name>.<value of the class>
    c. Tag and attribute(note that attribute is not a locator) => <tag_name>[attribute=value]
    d. Tag, class and attribute => <tag_name>.<value of the class>[attribute=value]

We create a value using above combination and pass it along with By.CSS_SELECTOR locator. Lets say that and element has
both tag name and id present in it. we create new value <tag_name>#<di>. tag_name is optional. so new value also can be
#<id>
Example : driver.find_element(by.CSS_SELECTOR, '<tag_name>#<di>')

2. Xpath :
DOM(Documentation object model) : It is an API interface provided by the browser. When web page is open, browser creates
DOM of the web page
Xpath works on the DOM view of web page

-> Xpath is defined as XML path
-> Xpath is a syntax or language to find the element of a web page using xml path expression
-> Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage suing HTML DOM Structure
-> Xpath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in DOM
-> Xpath is an address of the element

There are two types of Xpath:
1. Absolute/Full xpath : This will start navigating from 1st node till the element
Example : /html/body/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[2]/div/div[3]/form/div[4]/div[1]/div/div/input
It always start with /
2. Partial/Relative xpath : Relative path will start navigating from the node whose id is present in xpath and not from start
Example : //*[@id="m_login_email"] - here elements which we are looking for is itself having id, so it doesn't need to look
any further. Relative Xpath always starts with //*
Relative Xpath is preferred for testing as any changes in hierarchy of node will affect absolute x path

Writing relative x path manually : //<tag_name>[@attribute='value'].
Instead of tag name we can use * //*[@attribute='value'] - it will go to each tag and match the attribute value

SelectorsHub is extension available for all the browser to capture xpath
Xpath options and method:
1. AND => "//*[@attribute1='value' and @attribute2='value']"
2. OR => "//*[@attribute1='value' or @attribute2='value']"
3. contains() => This to test the dynamic element. Say there is start button which changes to stop immediately after a click
in that case relative path will be : "//[contains(@id='st')]" - st because it is the common text for start and stop
4. start-with() - above example can be used here as well because both start and stop starts with st :
//*[start-with(@id='st')]. In these situation "//*[@id='start' or @id='stop']" will also work
5. text()

Xpath axes : It is used to travel html dom both top and button from any specified node(self)
1. Child : Traveser all the child element of current node : //*[attribute=value]/child::tagname(tag name child element to travel)
2. Parent : Traverse parent element of the current html tag : //*[attribute=value]/parent::tagname
3. preceding : traverse all the element that comes before the current tag : //*[attribute=value]/preceding::tagname
4. follwing : traverse all the element that comes after current tag: //*[attribute=value]/follwing::tagname
5. Following-sibling : Traverse current tml tag to next sibling html tag
//current html tag[@attribute='value']/following-sibling::sibling tag[@attribute='value']
5. preceding-sibling : Traverse current tml tag to previous sibling html tag
//current html tag[@attribute='value']/preceding-sibling::sibling tag[@attribute='value']
6. Ancestor: Traverse all the ancestor elements(grand parent, parent, etc) of the current htm tag
//*[attribute=value]/ancestor::tagname
6. decendent: Traverse all the decendent elements(child parent, grandchild, etc) of the current htm tag
//*[attribute=value]/decendent::tagname

Types of Selenium command/method
1. application commands : get(), title, current_url, page_source(complete html source of the page)

2. conditional commands : these commands are access one element and not on driver object
is_displayed() - return true if selected element is displayed and false otherwise.
is_enabled() - to check if element is enabled. Like sometimes it is not allowed to enter value in boxes.
is_selected() - to select radio button and check boxes

3. browser commands :
1. close() : Closes the current browser window driver is focused on.
2. quit() : It will close all the browser windows opened and call to the session end of calling Dispose() method

4. Navigation commands : forward(), back() and refresh() - these are driver object commands

5. Wait commands
implicit_wait(), until() - explicit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
text vs get_attribute('value'):
test : this will only return the inner text of the element
if inner text for an element is not present we need to go for get_attribute('value')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
driver.submit() - is like pressing enter key
-----------------------------------------------------------------
//input[@class='value' and contains(@id, 'day')]

--------------------------------------------------------
dropdown
from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select
drop_driver_element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "")
drop_select = Select(drop_driver_element) - this has different method to select dropdown option
drop_select.select_by_visual_text()
x = drop_select.Options - this will give all the drop down options
for option in x:
    if option.text = 'india':
        option.click()

Alert Window and pop up windows
