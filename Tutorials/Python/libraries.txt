Paramiko is a Python library that makes a connection with a remote device through SSh. Paramiko is using SSH2 as a
replacement for SSL to make a secure connection between two devices. It also supports the SFTP client and server model.

To Make connection we need generate RSA key pair(public/private) and copy it host machine.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey username@my_remote_host.org

install paramiko

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
client = ssh.connect('10.100.200', post=22, username='chandra', password='*****')
stdin, stdout, stderr) = client.exec_command(command)

Pywinauto:
pywinauto is a set of python modules to automate the Microsoft Windows GUI. At its simplest it allows you to send mouse and
keyboard actions to windows dialogs and controls, but it has support for more complex actions like getting text data.

from pywinauto import Application
from pywinauto import mouse
from pywinauto import keyboard

app = Application().start(r'C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\sublime_text.exe')
print(app.windows())
